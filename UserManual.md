/Communications<br>
I live in email and treat it like IM.  Please don’t be offended by brevity and terse emails.<br>
Please don’t call, text, or dm.  Email please.<br>
Email is also my todo list. If we talk about something and you want me to do it please send me a reminder email.<br>
If you don’t hear back from me within a few days, bump the email thread.  I appreciate it a lot.<br>  
I do my own scheduling and generally suck at it.  If we don’t set up a calendar invite there is a good chance I totally forget about it.<br>  
I try to ignore my email on the weekends. Try being the operative word.<br> 
I read all my Twitter and Instagram DMs. I rarely respond. If you don’t know me, that is an ok way to reach out.<br>
I practice double opt-in introductions unless it is an intro to someone truly amazing. Please do the same for me.<br>
I can be truly incompetent about trivial things. I am absent minded.<br>
<br>
/Meetings<br>
I try to live by the Warren Buffet school of meetings and try to avoid having them.<br>
I quite dislike setting up a call or meeting to “chat”<br>
You might find me rude if I refuse a meeting or ask to do it over email. Sorry. I am just trying to save us both wasted time.<br>
<br>
/Personal<br>
If I am a jerk, do something dumb or generally seem oblivious, please please please let me know. I often have no clue. Your feedback is priceless and I love it. I value constructive criticisms over compliments.<br>
If you have suggestions for this document please let me know so I can add them. It is a work in progress.<br>
